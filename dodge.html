      <h1>Chevrolet Camaro</h1>
      <p>
      The Chevrolet Camaro is a mid-size[1][2] American automobile manufactured by Chevrolet, classified as a pony car[3][4].[5][6] It first went on sale on September 29, 1966, for the 1967 model year and was designed as a competing model to the Ford Mustang. The Camaro shared its platform and major components with the Firebird, produced by Chevy's sister division Pontiac, also introduced for 1967.
      </p>
      <p>
      Four distinct generations of the Camaro were developed before production ended in 2002. The nameplate was revived on a concept car that evolved into the fifth-generation Camaro; production started on March 16, 2009.[7] Over 5 million Camaros have been sold.
